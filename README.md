# ☕ Java-OOP Repository

Welcome to my **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** repository!  
This collection includes all my Java programs, exercises, and mini-projects organized by topic and chapter — covering fundamental and intermediate concepts in object-oriented design.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains multiple folders representing different chapters and coding exercises.  
Each folder focuses on specific OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, arrays, classes, interfaces, and exception handling.
